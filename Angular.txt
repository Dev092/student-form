------------------------------------------------------Angular-------------------------------------------------
@12 Feb
npm install @angular/cli -g

npm list -g @angular/cli -> pathName
set path=%path%;pathName
ng new 02-angular-starter --standalone=false
npm start / ng serve -o

ctr+c to stop


*How ng serve work ?
-ng serve--->angular.json--(sesrch entry point)-->index.html--(App-root)-->main.ts--(Bootstrap modules)-->appModule--(Bootstrap Component)-->appComponent--->app.component.html(output of app.component.html file will be included inside index.html)



D:\Angular\Workspace>node -v --------------to check node is present in system or not

D:\Angular\Workspace>npm -v

npm init --------------- create simple javascript project 

code . ------------to open vs code inside folder

-node index.js--------------------use to see output of js file in cmd.

-2nd mentod to execute is write this in json

 "scripts": {
   "start": "node index.js"

  },


npm install typescript --save-dev ----------------development dependency


npm install @angular/cli -g ------------to install angular CLI
ng version

set path=%path%;C:\Users\DEVK\AppData\Roaming\npm -----------------------use to set pathafter install angular cli by npm list -g @angular/cli

ng new 02-angular-starter --standalone=false ------------create angular project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -angular is typescript based frontend framework which is used to create 
  frontend of our application.(using angular we can create single page application)

-Rest api is used to connect 2 different kinds of application like java springboot application and 
node application.(through JSON they comunicate)


frontend-->angular application----JSON----->java application----------->database

npm=node package manager


purpose of package = package.json help to store details about the package including
 the dependencyes and script.
 
-script like start which is inbuld not custum script use "npm start"
-if we use custom name line "dev": "node index.js" then we have to run "npm run dev"


how to install nwe package-
*npm install <package_name> by default package install locally if want to install 
 globally use -g
* npm uninstall <package_name> to uninstall package

production dependancy- npm install typescript
development dependancy- npm install typescript --save-dev



-node_modules = stores actual dependency required for the project.if this is deleted by mistake use npm install to reinstall the dependancy.

-ng serve help to deployee the angular into node server.



*angular component is a main building block of a angular project using which we will get UI.
*command for creating an component called as "ng generate component <component_name>" or "ng g c <component_name>"
 file create afrer this command is welcome.component.ts, welcome.component.html, welcome.component.css, welcome.component.spec.ts and update app module.

#Binding
*sharing a data between its typesctipt class and its associate templete and vicevarsa.
*one way datawinding= when our data is moving from either typescript to html or html to
 typescript is called one way datawinding.



css
StyleURL-external css
styleurls= for multiple css files
styles use `` for multli line codes in js or ts


[value] used to one way communination

*to achive two way datawinding use banana box.[()]



-----------------------------------------------------------------------

@TypeScript
mkdir 05-typescript-starter
cd 05-typescript-starter
npm init --yes
npm install typescript

tsc main.ts ------------to compile
node main-----------to run ts 

-ts is a superset of js.
-all the features of js supported by the ts along with that some additional features support in ts.
   for that use "tsc main.ts".
-we cannot execute typescript for execute we have to convert it into js.
-typescript has some datatypes but js doesn't have datatypes.
-js is the dynamically typed language where as ts is a static type language.




@Modules
ng g m <module_name>
-Module is a basic building block of a angular project which can hold the componemts and 
the custon file along with that it register some services.

-NgModule is a decurator we will apply at the top of the class to make this class as a module.
-NgModule contains few attributes like 1.declaration contains- costom component and custom files.
-providers help to declare a services.

@Component
ng g c student/list-students

in app.mpdule.ts
 imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,    DepartmentsComponent
    StudentModule
  ],

in student.module.ts
exports: [ListStudentsComponent]

@Directive
-directive is a class which does a small change in your existing component or file.
3 Types of diractive in angular:
1. component directive
2. atribute directive ---- ngModel,ngStyle,ngClass
3. structural directive ---ngFor,ngIf

in app.component.html
<div *ngFor="let s of students">
    <app-list-students></app-list-students>
  </div>

in app.component.ts
export class AppComponent {
  title = '06-student-app';
  students:any[]=[
    {studentId:101,studentName:'Raj',studentScore:75},
    {studentId:103,studentName:'Ram',studentScore:95},
    {studentId:104,studentName:'Sayam',studentScore:65},
    {studentId:105,studentName:'Dev',studentScore:86}
  ]
}


- if we want to pass a data from parent component to child component then @Input decutator is used.


@Input=take data from parent to child.
@output=takes data from chlid to parent.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

arr:number[]=[]
let numArr:number[]=[1,2,3,4]

let strArr:string[]=['dev','ram']

function addtwo(a:number,b:number):number{
  return a+b;
}

function addtwo(a,b){
 return a+b;
}

class contain 2 no as a property 

class demp{
a:number,
b:number

add(a,b){
c=this.a+this.b;
}










create a class called factorial
in a class declare 1 property called nunber and initialise a property by parametrise constructor
create a fact function thich give factorial of a no.

#angular service
-angular service is singletun object.
-we keep our data in the service and that data can be shared by multiple component. 


@service
-ng g s <service_name>
-ng g s student/student


@Angular Pipe
-angular pipe will allow you to display data in custom format.
-pipe help to convert the file from one format to other.
-ng g p <pipe_name>
-pipe is also a typescript class with one special decurator called @Pipe 
and typescript class should implement pipe transform interface and transform function.

@atribute  directive
ngstyle
ngclass
ngmodel

-------------------------------angular Lifecycle-------------------
Three lifecycle hok-
-ngOn InIt
          --------inside oninit interface
-ngOn distroy       
          --------inside ondistroyee interface
-ngOn changes
          --------inside onchanges interface
*constructor and ngInit they will called only once during entire lifecycle of the component.

*ngOn init or ng distroyee is only called once during entire lifecycle.
*ng on change called every time when we make change inside component.


----------------------Form handling--------------
two way to use form in angular:
1.Templet driven form --useful when include everything inside html templet
                      --import formsModule

2.Reactive form  --most of the logic inside ts class.
                 --import reactiveFormsModule


*By using ngclass we can apply any css class dynamically on any particular value.
*By using ngStyle we can apply particular css property in page.


@Marathon:
1.typescript--class function ----------factorial ,multiplication table, prime number, sum of digit
2.component- databinding
3.form with databinding
4.data sharing bt parent chile @input,@output
5.http service


---------------------------http--------------------------
ui--->(MY.COMP.TS----->MYCCOMP.HTML----->MY.SERVICE.TS)---->REST API(JSON)----->JSON server
           ^                               ^
           |                               |
           --------------------------------

-npx json-server

-npx json-server --watch studentdb.json

-json is use for data transfer.

-httpget method helt to get all the data through the rest api and the returntype is observable.


-------------------------single page application-------------
-is a web application that intract with the user by dynamically rewriting the 
 current web page with the new data without reloading the entire webpage.
-by using routing we can achive the concept of single page application in npm.
